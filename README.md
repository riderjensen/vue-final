1. Effectively use conditional logic and JavaScript array methods to render large lists.  
[Decide.vue](https://github.com/riderjensen/vue-final-rider/blob/master/src/views/Decide.vue)

2. Encapsulate your code as VueJS single-file components.

3. Work with the Vue-CLI to create and manage your project within a real development toolset.  
[Package.json](https://github.com/riderjensen/vue-final-rider/blob/master/package.json)

4. Properly use Git for your source version control with an established record of at least 4 days of commits each week from October 15th through December 6th.
